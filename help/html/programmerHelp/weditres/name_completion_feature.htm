<p class="MsoNormal">When you type the start of an identifier and press the
Escape key, Wedit will try to find the closest match to the incomplete
identifier. If only one match is found, it will be inserted without further
questions. If multiple matches are found, you will be presented with a
contextual menu with those identifiers or with a dialog box if the number of
identifiers found is too great to be presented in a menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you press Escape after having written an identifier
followed by a point or a sequence of ‘-&gt;’ characters, Wedit will try to
find the fields of the structure you are writing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wedit tracks the include files to search for identifiers.
Comments will be ignored, but conditional definitions will not be executed
because for this, the preprocessor would have to run.</p>
