<h3><a name="_Toc494631978">Check Boxes</a></h3>
<p>A <i>check box</i> consists of a square box and application-defined text
(label), an icon, or a bitmap, that indicates a choice the user can make by
selecting the button. Applications typically display check boxes in a group box
to permit the user to choose from a set of related, but independent options. For
example, an application might present a group of check boxes from which the user
can select error conditions that produce warning beeps.</p>
<p>A check box can be one of four styles: standard, automatic, three-state, and
automatic three-state, as defined by the constants BS_CHECKBOX, BS_AUTOCHECKBOX,
BS_3STATE, and BS_AUTO3STATE, respectively. Each style can assume two check
states: checked (a check mark inside the box) or cleared (no check mark). In
addition, a three-state check box can assume an indeterminate state (a grayed
box inside the check box). Repeatedly clicking a standard or automatic check box
toggles it from checked to cleared and back again. Repeatedly clicking a
three-state check box toggles it from checked to cleared to indeterminate and
back again.</p>
<p>When the user clicks a check box (of any style), the check box receives the
keyboard focus. The system sends the check box's parent window a <a href="../../api/api2/menus_8wh0.htm"><b>WM_COMMAND</b></a>
message containing the <a href="../../api/api2/buttons_8810.htm"><b>BN_CLICKED</b></a>
notification code. The parent window doesn't acknowledge this message if it
comes from an automatic check box or automatic three-state check box, because
the system automatically sets the check state for those styles. But the parent
window must acknowledge the message if it comes from a check box or three-state
check box because the parent window is responsible for setting the check state
for those styles. Regardless of the check box style, the system automatically
repaints the check box once its state is changed.</p>
