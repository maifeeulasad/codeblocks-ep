<h3><a name="_Toc494631977">Push Buttons</a></h3>
<p>A <i>push button</i> is a rectangle containing application-defined text
(label), an icon, or a bitmap that indicates what the button does when the user
selects it. A push button can be one of two styles: standard or default, as
defined by the constants BS_PUSHBUTTON and BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON. A standard push
button is typically used to start an operation. It receives the keyboard focus
when the user clicks it. A default push button, on the other hand, is typically
used to indicate the most common or default choice. It is a button that the user
can select by simply pressing ENTER when a dialog box has the input focus.</p>
<p>When the user clicks a push button (of either style), it receives the
keyboard focus. The system sends the button's parent window a <a href="../../api/api2/menus_8wh0.htm"><b>WM_COMMAND</b></a>
message that contains the <a href="../../api/api2/buttons_8810.htm"><b>BN_CLICKED</b></a>
notification code. In response, the dialog box typically closes and carries out
the operation indicated by the button.</p>
<p>The default push button cannot be a check box, a radio button, or an
ownerdraw button at the same time.</p>
