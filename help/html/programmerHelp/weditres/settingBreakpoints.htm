<p class="MsoNormal">To set/unset a breakpoint, press F2. This will toggle a
breakpoint at the line where the cursor is located. If you are in the debugger,
a breakpoint symbol is shown at the left side of the affected line.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also edit the current breakpoint list using the
‘Edit breakpoints’ dialog box, which can be called up from the debugger
menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this dialog box, there is a list of all functions
defined in the running program at the left side. To set a breakpoint in any of
these functions, double-click on the large list box at the left side of the
dialog box. Note that this enables you to set a breakpoint at any function, even
those library functions where there is no source file associated with them. For
instance, to set a breakpoint in the library function ‘printf’, double-click
on its name. This is the only way to specify a breakpoint in these functions. F2
will not work here because there is no source file associated with that
function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can specify a source file and a line in the “New
breakpoint” edit field. This is enabled only when the debugger is active.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To specify a breakpoint that will be skipped &lt;n&gt;
times before it stops the program under debug, double-click on the breakpoint
you want to modify. Then enter the number of times to skip in the dialog box
that pops up. This feature is active only when the debugger is running, and the
settings will not be saved between debugging sessions.</p>
