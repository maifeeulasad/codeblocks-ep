<h2>Custom build options</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are some situations when you need to process a file
with another tool, not the compiler, to obtain a C source file. For instance,
the compiler sources themselves require the ‘lburg.&nbsp;exe’ utility, which
will build a C file from a machine description file. This machine description
file is stored in win32.md.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To describe this project to the IDE, add win32.md to the
project files. Wedit will notice that it cannot determine how this file will be
processed, since it does not end with the standard extensions .c, .asm, .obj. It
will open up a dialog box asking for more information. In that dialog box, enter
the command line that should be executed when this file changes. In this case,
enter&nbsp;:</p>
<p class="MsoNormalIndent" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>lburg win32.md win32.c<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You also need to specify the output of this command. The
output in this case is a file called «&nbsp;win32.c&nbsp;», which you add to
the project files.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a much simpler way, you can specify .asm files that will
be processed by the compiler, assuming lcc assembler syntax. If you want your
assembler files processed by another assembler, such as NASM, right click on the
open file and add a ‘file processor’ for that specific file. If, for
example, you have your assembler functions in a file called asmcalls.asm, you
open asmcalls.asm, add it to the project, then right click somewhere in the text
of that file. Then add «&nbsp;nasm.exe&nbsp;» as a file processor or
\utilities\bin\nasm.exe «&nbsp; if the tool is not in the path.</p>
