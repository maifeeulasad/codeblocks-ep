<h3 style="mso-list:skip">The statistical profiler</o:p>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">This profiler is a utility that allows
you to see where your program is spending its time. It operates by starting a
special debugging session in which the debugger interrupts the running program
approx. 1,000 times per second. When the debugger stops the program, it checks
what the program is currently executing and records each source line/function
that corresponds to the current program counter (EIP).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">When the program finishes running,
the debugger assembles the information it has gathered into a report in which
each function that was interrupted is shown with the number of hits it had.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">The logic behind this method is that
the longer a function executes the higher the probability that the debugger will
interrupt its execution. Since this is a statistical approach, the longer the
program runs, the more accurate the information of the profiler will be. Short
runs can introduce errors because the chance factor is higher. Longer runs
provide a more reliable report.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">When measuring a program’s
execution, you should run several profile sessions before using the data.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">To start a profiler session, you
should compile the program with the debug information ON of course. Use only the
lowest debug level (g2). Other debug levels will introduce a skew in the data,
since they affect the program’s runtime behavior. For instance, if you set the
debug level to g3, at each procedure call, the program will record the name of
the procedure in the stack, making procedure calls more costly, skewing the data
seen by the profiler.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">The profiler report will be loaded
automatically into the editor. You can save it or rename it as you would do with
any other text file.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">During the profiler session, the
debugger’s main window will appear. Do not use it because the profiler session
could be stopped or slowed down, rendering the data useless.</p>

<h3 style="mso-list: skip">The detailed profiler</h3>
<p style="mso-list: skip">This profiler works by injecting instrumentation code
in the executable and needs special support from the compiler and the run time
library profiler.lib. The compiler must be used with the -profile option, and
the linker should receive the profile.lib in its command line. Both options are
automatically added by the IDE when generating the makefile.</p>
<p style="mso-list: skip">When the program starts, it setups the profile
environment and then calls the main() function. When the program exits (either
through a return from main or by a direct call to the exit() function) the
profiler writes in the directory where the program was started the data
collected in the profiling session. The file name is &quot;__profile.data&quot;,
and contains information about the line numbers with a count for each line
number where the program passed, and a clock information for each function. This
information is given by module.</p>
<p style="mso-list: skip">The utility &quot;<a href="file:///D:/lcc/doc/manualchm/profilerdisplay.htm">profiler</a>&quot;
displays this information in a more advanced form. When the IDE is in charge, it
will start the program with the current command line options and call after it
finishes the profiler.exe utility to display the results.</p>
