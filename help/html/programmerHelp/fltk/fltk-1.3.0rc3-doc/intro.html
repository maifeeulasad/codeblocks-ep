<h1>Introduction to FLTK </h1>  </div>
</div>
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX&reg;/Linux&reg; (X11), Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;, and Apple&reg; OS X&reg;. FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL&reg; and its built-in GLUT emulation. It was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a small group of developers across the world with a central repository in the US.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_history"></a>
History of FLTK</h2>
<p>It has always been Bill's belief that the GUI API of all modern systems is much too high level. Toolkits (even FLTK) are <em>not</em> what should be provided and documented as part of an operating system. The system only has to provide arbitrary shaped but featureless windows, a powerful set of graphics drawing calls, and a simple <em>unalterable</em> method of delivering events to the owners of the windows. NeXT (if you ignored NextStep) provided this, but they chose to hide it and tried to push their own baroque toolkit instead.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas in FLTK were developed on a NeXT (but <em>not</em> using NextStep) in 1987 in a C toolkit Bill called "views". Here he came up with passing events downward in the tree and having the handle routine return a value indicating whether it used the event, and the table-driven menus. In general he was trying to prove that complex UI ideas could be entirely implemented in a user space toolkit, with no knowledge or support by the system.</p>
<p>After going to film school for a few years, Bill worked at Sun Microsystems on the (doomed) NeWS project. Here he found an even better and cleaner windowing system, and he reimplemented "views" atop that. NeWS did have an unnecessarily complex method of delivering events which hurt it. But the designers did admit that perhaps the user could write just as good of a button as they could, and officially exposed the lower level interface.</p>
<p>With the death of NeWS Bill realized that he would have to live with X. The biggest problem with X is the "window
manager", which means that the toolkit can no longer control the window borders or drag the window around.</p>
<p>At Digital Domain Bill discovered another toolkit, "Forms". Forms was similar to his work, but provided many more widgets, since it was used in many real applications, rather than as theoretical work. He decided to use Forms, except he integrated his table-driven menus into it. Several very large programs were created using this version of Forms.</p>
<p>The need to switch to OpenGL and GLX, portability, and a desire to use C++ subclassing required a rewrite of Forms. This produced the first version of FLTK. The conversion to C++ required so many changes it made it impossible to recompile any Forms objects. Since it was incompatible anyway, Bill decided to incorporate his older ideas as much as possible by simplifying the lower level interface and the event passing mechanism.</p>
<p>Bill received permission to release it for free on the Internet, with the GNU general public license. Response from Internet users indicated that the Linux market dwarfed the SGI and high-speed GL market, so he rewrote it to use X for all drawing, greatly speeding it up on these machines. That is the version you have now.</p>
<p>Digital Domain has since withdrawn support for FLTK. While Bill is no longer able to actively develop it, he still contributes to FLTK in his free time and is a part of the FLTK development team.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_features"></a>
Features</h2>
<p>FLTK was designed to be statically linked. This was done by splitting it into many small objects and designing it so that functions that are not used do not have pointers to them in the parts that are used, and thus do not get linked in. This allows you to make an easy-to-install program or to modify FLTK to the exact requirements of your application without worrying about bloat. FLTK works fine as a shared library, though, and is now included with several Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Here are some of the core features unique to FLTK:</p>
<ul>
<li>sizeof(Fl_Widget) == 64 to 92.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The "core" (the "hello" program compiled &amp; linked with a static FLTK library using gcc on a 486 and then stripped) is 114K.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The FLUID program (which includes every widget) is 538k.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Written directly atop core libraries (Xlib, WIN32 or Cocoa) for maximum speed, and carefully optimized for code size and performance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Precise low-level compatibility between the X11, WIN32 and MacOS versions - only about 10% of the code is different.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Interactive user interface builder program. Output is human-readable and editable C++ source code.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Support for overlay hardware, with emulation if none is available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Very small &amp; fast portable 2-D drawing library to hide Xlib, WIN32, or QuickDraw.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OpenGL/Mesa drawing area widget.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Support for OpenGL overlay hardware on both X11 and WIN32, with emulation if none is available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Text widgets with cut &amp; paste, undo, and support for Unicode text and international input methods.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility header file for the GLUT library.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility header file for the XForms library.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_licensing"></a>
Licensing</h2>
<p>FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is available under the terms of the <a class="el" href="license.html">GNU Library General Public License</a> with exceptions that allow for static linking. Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in commercial software - even Bill Gates could use it!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_what"></a>
What Does "FLTK" Mean?</h2>
<p>FLTK was originally designed to be compatible with the Forms Library written for SGI machines. In that library all the functions and structures started with "fl_". This naming was extended to all new methods and widgets in the C++ library, and this prefix was taken as the name of the library. It is almost impossible to search for "FL" on the Internet, due to the fact that it is also the abbreviation for Florida. After much debating and searching for a new name for the toolkit, which was already in use by several people, Bill came up with "FLTK", including a bogus excuse that it stands for "The Fast Light Toolkit".</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_unix"></a>
Building and Installing FLTK Under UNIX and Apple OS X</h2>
<p>In most cases you can just type "make". This will run configure with the default of no options and then compile everything.</p>
<p>For OS X, Xcode 3 project files can be found in the 'ide' directory.</p>
<p>FLTK uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your UNIX platform. The main things that the configure script will look for are the X11 and OpenGL (or Mesa) header and library files. If these cannot be found in the standard include/library locations you'll need to define the <code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>CXXFLAGS</code>, and <code>LDFLAGS</code> environment variables. For the Bourne and Korn shells you'd use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">CFLAGS=-Iincludedir; export CFLAGS
CXXFLAGS=-Iincludedir; export CXXFLAGS
LDFLAGS=-Llibdir; export LDFLAGS
</pre></div><p>For C shell and tcsh, use:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">setenv CFLAGS <span class="stringliteral">&quot;-Iincludedir&quot;</span>
setenv CXXFLAGS <span class="stringliteral">&quot;-Iincludedir&quot;</span>
setenv LDFLAGS <span class="stringliteral">&quot;-Llibdir&quot;</span>
</pre></div><p>By default configure will look for a C++ compiler named <code>CC</code>, <code>c++</code>, <code>g++</code>, or <code>gcc</code> in that order. To use another compiler you need to set the <code>CXX</code> environment variable:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">CXX=xlC; export CXX
setenv CXX <span class="stringliteral">&quot;xlC&quot;</span>
</pre></div><p>The <code>CC</code> environment variable can also be used to override the default C compiler (<code>cc</code> or <code>gcc</code>), which is used for a few FLTK source files.</p>
<p>You can run configure yourself to get the exact setup you need. Type "./configure &lt;options&gt;", where options are:</p>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-cygwin</b></dt><dd>Enable the Cygwin libraries under WIN32</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-debug</b></dt><dd>Enable debugging code &amp; symbols</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--disable-gl</b></dt><dd>Disable OpenGL support</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-shared</b></dt><dd>Enable generation of shared libraries</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-threads</b></dt><dd>Enable multithreading support</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-xdbe</b></dt><dd>Enable the X double-buffer extension</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-xft</b></dt><dd>Enable the Xft library for anti-aliased fonts under X11</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-x11</b></dt><dd>When targeting cygwin, build with X11 GUI instead of windows GDI</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--enable-cp936</b></dt><dd>Under X11, enable use of the GB2312 locale</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--bindir=/path</b></dt><dd>Set the location for executables [default = $prefix/bin]</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--datadir=/path</b></dt><dd>Set the location for data files. [default = $prefix/share]</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--libdir=/path</b></dt><dd>Set the location for libraries [default = $prefix/lib]</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--includedir=/path</b></dt><dd>Set the location for include files. [default = $prefix/include]</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--mandir=/path</b></dt><dd>Set the location for man pages. [default = $prefix/man]</dd></dl>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>--prefix=/dir</b></dt><dd>Set the directory prefix for files [default = /usr/local]</dd></dl>
<p>When the configure script is done you can just run the "make" command. This will build the library, FLUID tool, and all of the test programs.</p>
<p>To install the library, become root and type "make install". This will copy the "fluid" executable to "bindir", the header files to "includedir", and the library files to "libdir".</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_windows"></a>
Building FLTK Under Microsoft Windows</h2>
<p>There are three ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows. The first is to use one of the VisualC project files in the "ide" directory. Just open (or double-click on) the "fltk.dsw" or "fltk.sln" file to get the whole shebang.</p>
<p>The second method is to use the <code>configure</code> script included with the FLTK software; this has only been tested with the Cygwin tools:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">sh configure --prefix=C:/FLTK
make
</pre></div><p>The final method is to use a GNU-based development tool with the files in the "makefiles" directory. To build using one of these tools simply copy the appropriate makeinclude and config files to the main directory and do a make:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">copy makefiles\Makefile.&lt;env&gt; Makefile
make
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" id="intro_visualcpp"></a>
Using the Visual C++ DLL Library</h3>
<p>The "fltkdll.dsp" project file builds a DLL-version of the FLTK library. Because of name mangling differences between PC compilers (even between different versions of Visual C++!) you can only use the DLL that is generated with the same version compiler that you built it with.</p>
<p>When compiling an application or DLL that uses the FLTK DLL, you will need to define the <code>FL_DLL</code> preprocessor symbol to get the correct linkage commands embedded within the FLTK header files.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_internet"></a>
