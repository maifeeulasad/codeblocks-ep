  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h3>Can I get a copy of this site?</h3>

  <p>We do provide <a href=
  "http://www.cppreference.com/cppreference-files.tar.gz">a
  downloadable archived version of cppreference.com</a>. If you&#39;re
  interested in getting archived versions of websites in general, you
  might want to check out utilities like <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">GNU&#39;s wget</a>
  (Windows version <a href=
  "http://pages.interlog.com/~tcharron/wgetwin.html">here</a>).</p>

  <p>In addition, James Heany has compiled a PDF version of the site
  (as of October 2007) that is available for download.  There is a <a
  href="CppReferenceManual.pdf">C++ Reference PDF</a> and a <a
  href="Cpp_STL_ReferenceManual.pdf">STL Reference PDF</a> available
  for download.</p>

  <h3>Can I [mirror/translate/put up my own version of/etc.] this
  site?</h3>Sure, that would be great!  All that we would ask is that
  you include a link back to this site so that people know where to
  get the most up-to-date content.

  <h3>Who is this site meant for?</h3>There are no &quot;Introduction
  to Programming&quot; tutorials here. This site is meant to be used by
  more-or-less experienced C++ programmers, who have a good idea of
  what they want to do and simply need to look up the syntax. If
  you&#39;re interested in learning C/C++, try one of these sites:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/c.htm">How C Programming
    Works</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://www.its.strath.ac.uk/courses/c/">C Programming</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">C++ Language
    Tutorial</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Does this site contain a complete and definitive list of
  everything I can do with C/C++?</h3>Few things in life are
  absolute. Many C/C++ compilers have added or missing functionality.
  If you don&#39;t find what you are looking for here, don&#39;t
  assume that it doesn&#39;t exist. Do a search on <a
  href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for it.

  <h3>Some of the examples on this site don&#39;t work on my system.
  What&#39;s going on?</h3>Most of the code on this site was compiled
  under <a href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</a> (<a href=
  "http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>, <a href=
  "http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, or <a
  href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>) with the <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">Compiler Collection</a>.
  Since this site is merely a reference for the <a href=
  "http://www.ncits.org/cplusplus.htm"> Standard C and C++
  specification</a>, not every compiler will support every function
  listed here. For example,

  <ul>
    <!-- <LI>I've never had much luck getting 
                  <A HREF="cppbitset.html">C++ Bitsets</A>
                  to work on my computer - but they're listed here.  not needed now -->

    <li>Header files change like mad. To include the necessary support
    for <a href="cppvector/index.html">C++ Vectors</a>, you might have
    to use any of these:
<pre class="prettyprint">
  #include &lt;vector&gt;
  #include &lt;Vector&gt;
  #include &lt;vector.h&gt;
</pre>(according to the spec, the first of those should work, and the
compiler should know enough to use it to reference the real vector
header file.)
    </li>

    <li>Another header file issue is that newer compilers can use a
    more platform-independent commands to include standard C libraries.
    For example, you should be able to use
<pre class="prettyprint">
  #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
</pre>instead of
<pre class="prettyprint">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>All of the code on this site assumes that the correct namespace
    has been designated. If your compiler is a little old, then you
    might be able to get away with using simple statements like:
<pre class="prettyprint">
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world!&quot;;
</pre>However, newer compilers require that you either use
<pre class="prettyprint">
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world!&quot;;
</pre>or declare what namespace to use with the &quot;using
namespace&quot; command.
    </li>

    <li>Certain popular compilers (like the one shipped with
    Microsoft&#39;s Visual C++) have added alternative or additional
    functionality to the C++ Standard Template Library. For example,
    the MFC in Visual C++ provides you with the string type
    &quot;CString&quot;, which has string functionality but is not part
    of the C++ STL.</li>
  </ul>...The list goes on and on. In other words, individual results
  may vary.

  <h3>What&#39;s up with this site?</h3>Think of it as a community
