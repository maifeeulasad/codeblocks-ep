ErrMsg returns error descriptions for Windows system
error messages and HRESULT return codes.

A typical Windows system error would be decimal 5 for
"access denied" or 2 for "the system cannot find the
file specified" or 3 for "the system cannot find the
path specified" etc..

An HRESULT return code is the one that starts with 0x
and then 8 digits.  For example E_FAIL is the hex number
0x80000008 and returns the string "unspecified error" since
it's a catch-all COM or ActiveX error that just means the
operation failed. 0x80000005 is "invalid pointer" which
means there's a good chance the programs's memory got
corrupted or it used an uninitialized pointer(the
correct memory address was never inserted.)

More useful for programmers but may come in handy esp. for
those error dialogs that only give a hex error code.

When entering hex error codes make sure to put the 0x
at the beginning or else the lookup will be for a
decimal number and will return the wrong message.
